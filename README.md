# Choose A Number (GUI)

A fun GUI I wanted to create. This program asks for two numbers. When user
enters these two numbers, he can press a button to generate a random number
between the first and the second number he entered earlier.

The idea came one night when I had to choose a movie between many to watch, but
couldn't decide, so I wanted to pick a random one. That night i didn't watch
any movie, but at least I created a nice program, plus gained some
experience.
